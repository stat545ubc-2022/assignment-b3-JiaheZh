### Assignment B3 of UBC Stat545B
This github is created for assignment B3 of UBC stat545B class. I am choosing to do option B, which asks me to create my own app. 

### App Description
This app is created for users to explore the data regarding life expectancy, GDP percapita, and populations of different countries and continents. The data used in this app is collected from the gapminder data set, which provides data about the population, life expectancy and GDP in different countries of the world from 1952 to 2007. It's always very interesting to explore the development of different countries and continents around the world. This app allows users to explore the data of different continents individually, and to observe the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita of different continents individually as well. The app allows users to download the tables and plots in case they would like to save the tables and plots.

### Dataset Acknolwedgement
